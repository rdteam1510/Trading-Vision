# Description:

- This is a program to fetch companies' information and some their financials from two sources:

  - [Stockbiz](https://www.stockbiz.vn/)
- These are companies from three Vietnamese stock exchanges HOSE, HNX and UPCOM. This program will get data and put them to MongoDB. **However, data from companies on UPCOM is not fully updated on TradingView.** Therefore, these data are not shown on MongoDB.
